\section{Problem Setting and Challenges}
Our problem is to search for a subgraph 
with a smaller value of (\ref{eq:score_R}) under fixed budget constraint.
As mentioned abobe (Section \ref{sec:subgraphMining}), 
the search space of subgraphs is intractably large due to the combinatorial explosion.
Therefore, the searchable space is limited, and where to search is an important issue.
Simple search policies do not predict the direction of the search 
and it is difficult to find the better solution.
On the other hand, search policies that are too complex 
require a cost to determine the direction of the search and are inefficient.
Our challenge is to design an efficient search policy for a better solution 
 with as little computation as possible.
