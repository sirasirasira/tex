\section{Problem Setting and Challenges}
In this paper, the problem is to search for a subgraph 
that maximizes (\ref{eq:score_C}) or minimizes (\ref{eq:score_R}).
However, the search space of subgraphs (Section \ref{sec:subgraphMining}) is intractably large
due to the combinatorial explosion.
The naive search policy require very high computational costs 
and it is difficult to find the suitable solution.
Our challenge is to design a efficient search policy for subgraphs in a large search space
based on the discriminative criteria.
