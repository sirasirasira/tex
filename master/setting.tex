\section{Problem Setting and Challenges}
Our problem is to search for a subgraph $g$
%that maximizes (\ref{eq:score_C}) or minimizes (\ref{eq:score_R}).
that minimizes (\ref{eq:score_R}).
However, the search space of subgraphs (Section \ref{sec:subgraphMining}) is intractably large
due to the combinatorial explosion.
The naive search policy require very high computational costs 
and it is difficult to find the suitable solution.
Our challenge is to design an efficient policy for searching subgraphs in a large search space
based on the discriminative criteria.
