\section{Conclusion}
\begin{comment}
In summary, we proposed a novel efficient algorithm to learn the nonlinear model 
using subgraph indicators without any class constraint.
In addition to solving computational cost problems, 
our algorithm using MCTS improves generalization ability compared to previous methods.
The search efficiency and prediction accuracy were empirically evaluated by experiments using real datasets.

On the other hand, it is still necessary to investigate the proposed method. 
In this paper, we set the number of Monte Carlo simulations empirically, and there is no uniform standard.
Some MCTS methods may provide theoretical guarantees for searching.
Furthermore, the performance may be improved by adopting some advanced methods of MCTS 
and domain specific heuristics.
