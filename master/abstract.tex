Recently, in various fields such as computational chemistry and bioinformatics,
attention has been paid to classification and regression
of data whose inputs are graphs of arbitrary size and shape, 
sometimes called graph classification/regression.
In these problems,
whether a certain subgraph is included or not 
is a fundamental feature for graphs that have no direct descriptors available.
The simplest solution, 
enumerating subgraph patterns and use them as features, is so expensive 
since the number of possible subgraph patterns are intractably large 
due to the combinatorial explosion.
Currently, discriminative pattern mining has been studied and given a good solution to this problem.
The previous search method for such discriminative subgraph patterns 
tries to find the best one by the depth first search with some pruning rules.
Such a exact search, however, is costly for heavily repeated use, 
which is necessary to obtain the number of features enough for high performance classifiers or regressors.
To overcome this computational cost issue, 
we propose two approximate algorithms based on 
$(i)$ best first search, $(ii)$ Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). 
We demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed methods by comparing performance 
in real problems using QSAR datasets.
