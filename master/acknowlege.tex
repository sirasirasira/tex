\section*{acknowlege}
In writing this paper, 
I would like to thank Associate Professor Nakamura for his very kind guidance 
to me who moved from another laboratory.
I also thank Professor Kudo for his guidance from various perspectives too.
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my family and 
all those who supported me for six years from undergraduate school.
