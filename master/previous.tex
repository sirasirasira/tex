\section{Depth First Search with Branch and Bound}
State of the art methods \cite{Saigo:2009, Shirakawa:2018} 
searching for a discriminative subgraph pattern is 
based on the depth first search, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:search} (a), with branch and bound.
\cite{Saigo:2009} searches the best subgraph patttern using $CScore$. 
This method calculates the bound of child node of search space, 
and if the bound is lower than the provisional solution the child is pruned.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:bound_C}
  Given $\D_1(g)$ and $\D_0(g)$, for any subgraph $g' \sqsupseteq g$,
  \begin{multline}
    \label{eq:bound_C}
    CScore(g') \leq 
    \max \Big[ 2 \sum_{\{n | y_n=+1, D_1(g)\}} y_n - \sum_{n=1}^{l}y_n, 
	-2 \sum_{\{n | y_n=-1, D_1(g)\}} y_n + \sum_{n=1}^{l}y_n \Big]
  \end{multline}
\end{theorem}
%Similarly, in \cite{Shirakawa:2018}, 
the bound is calculated based on $RegressionScore$ and used for pruning.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:bound_R}
  Given $\D_1(g)$ and $\D_0(g)$, for any subgraph $g' \sqsupseteq g$,
  \begin{multline}
    \label{eq:bound_R}
    RScore(g') \geq 
    \mymin{(\diamond,k)} \Big[ \mse(\D_1(g) \setminus S_{\diamond, k}) + \mse(\D_0(g) \cup S_{\diamond, k}) \Big]
  \end{multline}
  where $ (\diamond, k) \in \{ \leq, > \} \times \{ 2, \dots, |\D_1(g) - 1| \} $,
  and $S_{\diamond, k} \subset \D_1(g)$, such that $S_{\leq, k}$ is
  a set of $k$ pair $(G_i, r_i)$ selected from $\D_1(g)$ in descending order of residual error $r_i$,
  and $S_{>, k}$ is that in increasing order.
  Note that $\setminus$, $\cup$ are set difference and set union respectively.
\end{theorem}
